## Overview
This project is a **Three-Way Currency Converter** built using JavaFX. It allows users to seamlessly convert values between **fiat currency, cryptocurrency, and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to select the desired conversion type and input amounts.

Additionally, it integrates an **API** to fetch real-time exchange rates from the internet, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions.
